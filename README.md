## Python Automation | AWS Cloud Engineering | Linux Systems

I design automation-first workflows using Python and AWS.
My focus is replacing manual processes with secure, scalable scripts.

I build with one principle:
If it can be repeated, it must be automated.

## Engineering Focus

Cloud Fundamentals:
- IAM (least privilege design)
- EC2 (compute orchestration)
- S3 (static hosting, storage automation)
- VPC (network isolation basics)
- Lambda (event-driven compute)
- CloudWatch (monitoring and visibility)

Automation:
- Python scripting for infrastructure tasks
- boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
- CLI tooling
- Git-based deployment workflows

Systems:
- Linux-first development
- Bash scripting
- Terminal-native workflows

## Current Direction

- AWS Certification track (Cloud Practitioner → Solutions Architect)
- Infrastructure automation with Python
- Secure cloud design patterns
- Cost-aware engineering decisions

Certificates validate knowledge.
Automation proves competence.

### GitHub CLI Automation
Menu-driven CLI to automate repetitive GitHub tasks.
Built to reduce friction in daily workflows.

## How I Work

- Manual steps are bugs.
- Security is not optional.
- Scripts should be readable by future-me.
- Console clicking is a last resort.
- Cloud resources must justify their cost.

## Long-Term Goal

Cloud engineer specializing in infrastructure automation.
Python-driven AWS environments.
Repeatable deployments.
Auditable systems.
Minimal human error.
